# Legos Project

As a part of Databases for Data Science (CAP5322) for New College of Florida's Master's of Data Science program, we were required to choose a dataset, ask and answer some questions, and deploy our results to the NCF virtual machine using flask, python, and PostgreSQL. This project explores the different LEGO sets the user can build, given a set-number(s), and also can return the needed parts to complete a non-full set.

## Dataset

We used the [Legos](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/lego-database) dataset.
